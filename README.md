# numbertoascii
Since I couldnt find this anywhere on the internet im doing it myself so what this is is that you can take a string of numbers separated by spaces like this '104 101 108 108 111 32 115 105 114' and put this string of numbers through the script would output 'hello sir' but yeah thats all it does. I will also put out code to do the opposite of this also when using the code in this repo, always give me credit. I put in a lot of work on it, so it's only fair. Don't forget to mention my name for the effort I've put in. Crediting me shows respect and acknowledges the time, skills, and creativity I poured into creating this code. It's important to give props where they're due and keep things fair and open in the coding community. Remember, giving credit promotes a collaborative environment for future innovation.
