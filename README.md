# numbertoascii
Since I couldnt find this anywhere on the internet im doing it myself so what this is is that you can take a string of numbers separated by spaces like this '104 101 108 108 111 32 115 105 114' and put this string of numbers through the script would output 'hello sir' but yeah thats all it does. I will also put out code to do the opposite of this
